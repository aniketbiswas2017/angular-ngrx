Angular assessment leveraging the latest version of Angular + NgRx

This project leverages the latest version of Angular, comprises of a Product List and Product Details Page comprising of different types of coffee beans from around the world.

- It retrieves a list of 50 coffees items from [this link.](https://random-data-api.com/api/coffee/random_coffee) The API documentation can be found [here.](https://random-data-api.com) 

- The data is managed via the NgRx Store, HTTP requests dispatched via NgRx Effects, used NgRx Selectors for retrieving data from the Store.

- Implemented pagination, with a limit of 10 items per page, and uses OnPush ChangeDetection.

- There are two pages: The Home page(default) contains the List of coffee items and the Details page contains the coffee details. 

- My name is in the footer along with my linkedIn account and gmail link, to prove that I have also completely read these directions.

- I have also made use of route parameters to see each products details along with a Page not found component for 404 error.

- I have made use of [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/), which is a popular Angular User Interface (UI) component library and [Angulart Flex Layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout) which is a a stand-alone library developed by the Angular team for designing responsive layouts.

- The layout is responsive and have mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints, harnessing the flex layout for Angular.
